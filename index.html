                    <p>Self-learning is the method of gathering, processing, and retaining knowledge without the help of another person. Any knowledge you get outside of a formal educational setting, such as through self-study or experience, is self-driven learning. This approach can be beneficial for people who prefer learning at their own pace or who don't have enough time to complete academic courses or programs. While this approach isn't a replacement for academic qualifications, it represents an additional learning method that anybody can use for skill development.</p>

                    <h1>Gives control over the learning experience</h1>
                    <p>Self-driven learning gives learners the flexibility to think, interpret, and apply the knowledge they gain at their own pace, which is often not possible with system-centric learning. It also allows learners the freedom to refer to multiple knowledge sources. With this type of learning, learners  can easily monitor their progress and adjust the learning experiences to match their preferences. This can be particularly helpful for working professionals whose schedules make it more difficult to pursue in-class learning.</p>

                                <p>An auditory learner depends on listening and speaking as a main way of learning.[1] Auditory learners must be able to hear what is being said in order to understand and may have difficulty with instructions that are drawn but if the writing is in a logical order it can be easier to understand. They also use their listening and repeating skills to sort through the information that is sent to them. They are good listeners when people speak.[2]</p>
